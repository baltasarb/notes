## Description  

This [repository](https://github.com/baltasarb/notes) and [wiki](https://github.com/baltasarb/notes/wiki) contain information and exercises of various computer science related topics that while studying I decided to catalog for later use. The topics vary greatly and as such some might be more complete than others.

Disclaimer: information might not be 100% accurate. These are my personal notes.
